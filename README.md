eBay Listing Analyzer - Give it an ebay url and provides listing analysis for improving it.

In working for an ecommerce/ebay reseller, I realized that it was not easy to identify why certain listings sold, and others didn't.

So this is still in rough draft, a way to help analyze why listings need improvement.

Future Goals:
1. Test Everything
2. Write out more detail specifications
3. Add more analytical capabilities
